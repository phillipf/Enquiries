## GitHub Documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

read in the annual call qualifier data 

```{r load}
CallQual <- read_delim("N:/ABR/Output 2 Root Cause SRM and Repeats/data for phil 03 oct.txt", delim = "\t")
```

fix any parsing failures due to inconsistent delimeters

```{r fix parsing fails}
CallQual2 <- Enquiries::ParsingFailFix(CallQual)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
